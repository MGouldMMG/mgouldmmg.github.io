	<H1>Functional Testing</H1>	
"What is the system supposed to do?"</br>
</br>
Some of the commonalities in terms of areas to be tested are log files, rendering issues, performance, consistency, storage, memory issues, caching problems, and security vulnerabilities.</br>
</br>
There are also overlaps in terms of testing strategies that can be used, including:</br>
</br>
1.Blink test: Looking for visual patterns by constantly switching between similar versions of pages or apps to notice minute differences in rendering or visual elements</br>
2.Installation testing: Installing, uninstalling, and reinstalling apps, including upgrading apps from much earlier versions</br>
3.Interrupt testing: Testing how an end-user will use the app by constantly texting, calling, or switching apps on the test phone. The same could be done for web pages</br>
4.Testing with different configurations: Testing apps on different mobile devices and OS versions. Similar to browser testing, which involves testing in different browser versions or testing in desktop applications with different versions of the clientâ€™s application</br>
5.Checking for consistency: Checking for app consistency between Android and iOS. Similar to looking for consistency in pages by testing between browsers, between browser and mobile, and between desktop applications</br>
6.Checking user reviews: Reading through user reviews to find out how end-users feel about your app and how they use it. This applies to desktop applications and websites as well</br>
7.Checking for rendering issues: Checking whether web pages display differently based on different mobile browsers and screen sizes</br>
8.Black Box testing</br>
9.Code Review</br>
10.Code Coverage</br>
11.Functional Testing</br>
12.Interoperability testing</br>
13.Load Testing</br>
Response time under a load</br>
14.Maintainability testing</br>
15.Performance testing</br>
16.Portability testing</br>
17.Reliability testing</br>
18.Security testing</br>
19.Stress testing</br>
Takes software to the point of failure</br>
20.Usability testing</br>
21.Whitebox testing</br>
Static analysis tools - 
22.Structural testing</br>
23.Scalability testing</br>
Check on the elasticity of the application to scale up/down/out
